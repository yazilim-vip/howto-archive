# HowTo Archive

Welcome to HowTo Archive projct.

## Motivatation
The learning process consists of 3 stages: loading, experiencing and flowing. Flow is the name given to the process of working with the highest efficiency a person can achieve on a subject. For flow to take place, the first 2 steps must work perfectly: and without experiencing, flow can never happen. 

The Howto archive provides us with knowledge, whose accuracy and operability have been proven by experience, and shortens our experience cumulatively. Each experience makes the process shorter and more practical. 

Archiving experiences into a written document helps us to overcome the natural challenge of setting up an environment in the software development process. People constantly complain that we forgot something, but the HowTo archive is a very well designed resource to manage things we don't have to remember.
